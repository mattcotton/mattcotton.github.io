For as long as I can remember I've had a website, and up until very recently this was based on WordPress.

WordPress is a solid platform, but I realised that I was spending more time maintaining the site or looking for new themes than creating content for it! I wanted something that just allowed me to easily write a new post and display it in a clean way. That way I'd actually write more, right?!

[Jekyll][jekyll-docs] had always appealed to me because of it's use of Markdown and integration with [GitHub][github], so I decided that I should migrate my site and take advantage of the hosting that [GitHub Pages][ghpages] offers.

When I say migrate, there wasn't a lot that I wanted to bring with me from the WordPress site, so I'm really starting from scratch.

Hopefully this is the first post of many, with Jekyll's help!
